Please also have a look in our [OnlineHelp](https://help.theobald-software.com/en/) for further information.

In case of RFC connection errors (e. g. if the destination system is not reachable or if wrong credentials were supplied) a file named "dev_rfc.trc" may be generated by the librfc32.dll, which contains low-level tracing information.

Since ERPConnect version 4.2.18.x all trace files are disabled by default and can be configured via R3Connection.LogDir and R3Connection.Logging.

There is a bug in librfc32.dll related to this. Current versions (in which the problem is fixed) can be found [here](../general/useful-links).
